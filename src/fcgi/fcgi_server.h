/**
 * @file fcgi_server.h
 * @brief FastCGI server — accept loop, request parsing, and response writing.
 *
 * Wraps the libfcgi library (both the high-level FCGI_stdio API used in
 * spawn-fcgi mode and the lower-level FCGX API used in direct-socket mode).
 *
 * The original eibread-cgi / eibwrite-cgi reference implementations used the
 * simpler FCGI_stdio API exclusively and ran under spawn-fcgi.  This class
 * extends that model with a direct-socket mode that supports a fork-based
 * worker pool without requiring spawn-fcgi.

/**
 * @brief Main FastCGI server: accepts requests and dispatches them to handlers.
 *
 * Uses the libfcgi library for the FCGI protocol implementation.
 *
 * Supports two operating modes:
 *   1. **Spawn-fcgi mode** (default): reads/writes FCGI on stdin/stdout as
 *      configured by spawn-fcgi or a web server.  Concurrency is achieved by
 *      running multiple process instances via spawn-fcgi's `-F` flag.
 *      This is the mode used by the reference eibread-cgi / eibwrite-cgi.
 *   2. **Direct socket mode**: call listen() to open a TCP or Unix socket,
 *      then run() to accept connections.  For concurrent clients, main.cpp
 *      uses a fork-based worker pool — each child process calls run() on the
 *      inherited listen fd.
 *
 * @note In direct socket mode, FCGX_Init() must be called before
 *       FCGX_Accept_r().  FCGX_InitRequest() alone does not set the
 *       libInitialized flag, causing FCGX_Accept_r() to return -9998.
